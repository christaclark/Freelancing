 <h1>Business basics & Getting started</h1>
You can stay in bed all day, but you won’t want to.
When you picture your ideal lifestyle:
How do you picture working?
What time of day is it?
What kind of clients do you want to attract? What are you working on?
<br>
<br>
<b>  ...But why?</b>
Why are you leaving your job?
Why do you want to freelance?
Do you want to have a greater impact? What really inspires you?
<br>
<br> 
  <h2>Crafting a schedule</h2>
What are the constants in your week? 
What do you need to make time for? 
Schedule everything, even play time. 
Always leave ample room in between.
<br>
<br>

<b> Rule of Thumb: It’s safe to assume that projects will take at least 2 to 3 times longer than you think they will. </b> 
<br>
<br>
<h2>Married to the money... or not.</h2>
Do you have as much money as you want; how much do you need to make?
What hangups do you have about money that could prevent you from making as much as you want? What don’t you know?
<br>
<br>
<b>Make Uncle Sam proud</b>
Is your company filed with the state? 
Do you have a CPA?
Do you have a budget?
Do you have a business account and a savings account for your taxes?
<br>
<br>



 <h1>Hiring and Firing</h1>
 <b>How to Find + Keep Clients</b>
Breathe. It will take a few tries.
Try working on an array of different projects and see what you enjoy. 
There may be something you never knew you would love working on.
<br>
<br>
<b>Find a niche</b>
Are you building websites; if so what kind? E-commerce, landing pages, Wordpress, HTML5 & JS, MEAN stack?
Are you doing web or mobile apps?

<br>
<br>
<h2>Who are your Clients? </h2>
Who do you want to work with?
What motivates them/ their customers? Where do they live; local or abroad? Why do they want your service?
How big of projects do you want?

<br>
<br>
<b>Your first client!! </b>
Make it rain business cards
Tell EVERYONE you’re freelancing Go to networking events
Spam people on your Facebook or social media
<br>
<br>
<b>Friends and Family?</b>
Do pro-bono or cheap work for friends, they will be your cheerleaders.
This is not for everyone, but you will be able to work with anyone if you can work with your family members!
<br>
<br>

<h2>Onboarding Clients</h2>
Don’t be afraid to ask the tough questions, you are interviewing them as much as they are you.
Be transparent and treat them as a friend.

<br>
<br>
 <b>Managing Clients</b>
Always have a contract.
Retainers can be awesome income.
Know your worth, when it’s wise to compromise and when it’s not.
<br>
<br>
<b>Contracts</b>
PLEASE set a limit on revisions!
How much to ask for deposit?
Hourly or set price; learn to quote. 
What are you offering (and say no to)?

<br>
<br>
<b>Deposits</b>
Charge what you are comfortable taking a risk on. There’s the possibility they won’t pay you.
Most take 1⁄3 to 1⁄2, but you can take all.
<br>
<br>
<b>... You are now the expert</b>
The client is paying you for your expertise, but know your limits.
Above all else, stay humble.
<br>
<br>
<b> User Experience > most other things </b>
Understand your clients’ users/ customers as much as your clients themselves.
How will what you are building make their lives better or easier?
<br>
<br>
<h2> Let’s address being awkward and how to not do it. </h2>

<b>Checkins</b>
Communicate as often as possible.
Checking in with your client and letting them know where you are at is crucial for the relationship. Ask them about this before you even start working.
<br>
<br>
<b>Set boundaries + expectations</b>
Let them know what your schedule is and what to expect.
If they still text or email you on Saturday night, don’t respond until Monday. 
Retrain them.
<br>
<br>
<b>Invoicing</b>
Agree upon a payment schedule.
When is payment due; before, during, or after the project?
Are they going to need a retainer for regular maintenance? How many hours?
<br>
<br>
<b>Let’s talk about the actual work and how to provide high quality work </b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Timelines</b>
After a few projects you will feel more comfortable with quoting a timeline and I recommend you create one for yourself to apply to general projects.
<br>
<br>



<h1>Process</h1>
It’s helped to have a defined process of how working with you will go and what people can expect.
<br>
<br>

<b> Who has questions about the actual technical work or process?</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Ask for help, often.</b>
If I spend more than 30 minutes to an hour on something, I’ll ask a friend.
It’s challenging work, full of ups and downs, but you can do it. Just be prepared and always keep learning.
 
 <br>
<br>
<b>You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
So it’s important to hangout with people that will challenge and inspire you. </b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Get a mentor</b>
This is a relationship that will have to happen naturally. If you find someone you really admire, don’t get all creepy.
Try taking them out to lunch or coffee.
<br>
<br>

<b>Jack of all trades, master of none </b>
I outsource everything I can not, will not, and <b>should not</b> do.
What are some things that fall in these categories for you? What do you spend unnecessary time on?
<br>
<br>

<b>Lone wolf or pack animal?</b>
Is it a good idea to hire other devs? 
Can you support another person? 
Contract or employee?
If you do, make sure you train them adequately and build trust from the start. 
I recommend working with at least one other.

  “We’re naturally ambitious, driven people who take giant leaps many others don’t or won’t. We’re often labeled “risk takers,” “mavericks” and “renegades.” We take bold steps. We understand the potential
    consequences, but we still blaze trails.” - Kristen Wright
