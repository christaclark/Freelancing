Resources Specifically for Design/ Branding - 
Whether you’re new and don’t know where to start or need some ideas for branding or website/ Wordpress design, take full advantage of templates! When building out websites or branding kits, I’ll often buy a website from https://themeforest.net/ or grab a cool, custom font from https://graphicriver.net/. There’s a tone of beautiful, pre-built resources you can leverage for both quality examples and saving you time.

If you’re hungry for a cheap and quick online class about specifically Wordpress development, this is a good one to check out. https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/learn-wordpress/
