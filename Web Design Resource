Freelancing Web Design Business Resource 
Please keep in mind that this document is for web designers and freelancers that specialize in making websites, the content of which focuses solely on the client relationship cycle, not technical expertise.

Know your value 
* You need to get VERY clear on the value you contribute. 
    * Your main goal is to listen to what they are dealing with, what their pain points are, what its costing them.
    * Most importantly how you can offer them a solution to fix their problems and add value to their business/ boost their bottom line. 
* You want clients to see the value in what you are offering and most importantly that can afford it. 
    * You are likely charging too little. If someone baulks at your pricing, they are not the client for you. 
    * If they are unwilling to give you a deposit upfront (I will usually take half or a little less depending on the size), they are likely not going to pay you in full if not at all. 
* You don’t want to work with someone who’s freaked out by spending their life savings, you want a professional that rocks at their business and respects the quality you provide in yours  (and entrepreneur because they understand the hustle).


How it Works
* Remember our friend Feynman? Be more like him. Make this super upfront, direct, and easy to understand when you are talking about your process. This will not only make it easier to land good clients, but could provide great marketing material for yourself as well.



What to do with a Potential Client
* Most of my business is referral based, because happy customers will brag to their friends. I’ve found networking events and speaking engagements are great opportunities for potential work. However when I was first getting started, I posted on my Facebook about how I was “building websites now” and asked people if they knew anyone in need of one. This was super effective and created a great launchpad for initial work.
* Figure out how to very simply say what you do, such as “I build websites for local restaurants.” This makes it really easy for people to understand and they will like you for it. Be more like Feynman.
* Whether you get a referral or meet someone in passing, always be sure to get their information and on their calendar asap while you’re fresh in their mind.
    * While on the call, tell them you will send them the proposal the next day and schedule a follow up call within a week. 


Land the Client 
* I prefer meeting face-to-face with potential clients and recommend it, but appreciate this isn’t always feasible. However depending on the proposed size of the project, it may be necessary. 
* Find a Niche
    * Finding a niche is a good idea because you will quickly gain domain expertise and much more effectively deliver to clients. 
    * The more you do a certain kind of project or work with a particular kind of client, you will get faster and better. 
    * This will also help you develop a more standardized process, know expectations, and estimate a hell of a lot better.
* Get clear on expectations 
    * This is your opportunity to set up an agreement that will make the rest of working with someone mostly enjoyable (or really terrible and may cause some tears if you don’t). 
    * Let them know what your expectations are of the process are ahead of time, such as a ballpark timeline, how you conduct discovery, design approval process, development process, how many change iterations you’re willing to except..etc.
    * At this stage its important to define what success looks like and figure out if ongoing work or maintenance makes sense. 
        * How much will that cost? Is it per month or on an hourly/ as needed basis? 
    * What are some add-ons or up sells you can offer them, such as social media pages, branding guide, logo design. website hosting..etc.
    * You also want to be VERY clear about communication frequency: 
        * Do they want to talk every day or is it a longer project where weekly updates ok?
        * Let them know if you prefer to communicate via Slack, email, phone calls..etc.
        * Let them know when are times that are appropriate to contact or not and how long they can expect in between responses. This could be anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours depending on what you are comfortable with.
    * Craft a relative timeline and work schedule together so they can be fully prepared. This will include by when you need the necessary things from THEM. For example, I make all of my clients send me “homework” answering a series of important questions, along with a fat deposit and all of their site content before I even get started.

Writing a Proposal
* I’ve included a sample of a proposal, which should always be written in plain English and be 2-3 pages long. 
    * The goal is to make the value of what you will deliver as well as the cost and expectations really clear.
    * If they except the proposal or send a couple edits you are ok with, draw into a contract and have you both sign it.
* Write up a proposal (from template 2-3 pages) the same night after the call. 
    * Promptly send it out the next morning so it will end up at the top of their inbox and you don’t have to worry about it.
    * Turning around a client can be anywhere from a day to a year, they will move as quickly as they are ready.
* Timeline will depend on how ready and prepared they are.
    * Be clear that this process will move as quickly as they want and will depend on them.
    * Level of effort will also depend upon number of changes they want to make and how nit-picky they are. Make it clear that you will only allow for an agreed upon number of changes and more will incur an additional cost.
