Below is a compilation of resources I've been asked about that I thought would be helpful for new developers and designers  looking to get into the freelance game.

I found this awesome job board specifically for junior developers: https://www.jrdevjobs.com/
Built in Austin http://www.builtinaustin.com/ is another great resource for tech jobs in Austin. 

For freelancing jobs specifically, I recommend either https://www.upwork.com or https://www.freelancer.com/, also I believe you are already partnered up with vitamintalent.com who’s also a great resource.

I thought this was a great blog about freelancing:
